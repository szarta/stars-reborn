        "<p>The only mining ship available to you will be the Mini-Miner.  Your maximum population per planet is increased by 10%.  Note that if, somehow, a race has both traits Only Basic Remote Mining and Advanced Remote Mining selected, Only Basic Remote Mining will apply.</p>",

Normally, through miniaturization, the cost of component will eventually drop to 24% of its initial cost.</p> <p>Bleeding Edge Technology makes all components cost 200% of their cost when initially researched.  One technology level above, however, will cause the costs to drop to 95% and the cost will drop 5% per tech level, to a final cost of 20% of its initial cost.</p> <p>As a result of the above, technology components gained at Tech 26 will always cost twice as much.</p>",

To start, your homeworld and secondary planets will have stargates.</p> <p>Eventually you will be able to build stargates that have unlimited capabilities.  Stargates also cost you 25% less to build.</p> <p>If an enemy planet is in range of your stargate, you will automatically scan their planet if they have a stargate.</p> <p>Finally, exceeding the stated limits of stargates is less likely to destroy your ships.</p>",

The Stealth Bomber and Rogue hull types are only available to your race, as well as a scanner, shield, and armor with stealthy properties.</p> <p>You also get two special scanners that allow you to steal minerals from enemy fleets and planets.  You may travel safely through mine fields at one warp speed faster than the normal limits.</p>",

You are given a small and cheap colony hull and an engine that travels at Warp 6 without using fuel.</p> <p>Your people will grow at twice the growth rate specified in step 4. The maximum growth rate for all planets is halved.</p> <p>The Meta Morph hull is only available to your race.</p>",

Your starbases are 20% cheaper to build.</p> <p>If a starbase at your planet is destroyed, all of the colonists will be destroyed with it.  Your population maximums are determined by the type of starbase at that planet.  Eventually you will be able to build the fearsome Death Star.</p> <p>You do not build planetary installations such as mines, factories, and defenses, however your colonists have an intrinsic ability to mine.
